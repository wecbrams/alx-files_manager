# 0x04. Files manager

![Back-end]() ![JavaScript]() ![ES6]() ![NoSQL]() ![MongoDB]() ![Redis]() ![NodeJS]() ![ExpressJS]() ![Kue]()

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!

- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the js extension
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint

## Provided files

```package.json
   .eslintrc.js
